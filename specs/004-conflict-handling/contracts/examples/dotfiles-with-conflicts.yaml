# Example: Dotfiles with Potential Conflicts
# Purpose: Demonstrates a typical dotfile configuration where target files may already exist
#
# Scenario: User has existing .bashrc, .gitconfig, and .config/nvim on their system
# Expected behavior:
#   - Without --force: dottie link fails, lists all 3 as conflicts
#   - With --force: backs up existing files, creates symlinks

profiles:
  default:
    dotfiles:
      # Shell configuration - commonly exists on most systems
      - source: shell/bashrc
        target: ~/.bashrc

      # Git configuration - frequently customized per-machine
      - source: git/gitconfig
        target: ~/.gitconfig

      # Editor configuration - often already present
      - source: editors/nvim
        target: ~/.config/nvim

      # SSH config - sensitive, often has local modifications
      - source: ssh/config
        target: ~/.ssh/config
