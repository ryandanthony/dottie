# Integration test for variable substitution across install types
# Tests: variables in script paths, apt packages, and SIGNING_FILE in apt repos
#
# On Ubuntu 24.04 container:
#   ${ID} → ubuntu
#   ${VERSION_CODENAME} → noble
#   ${MS_ARCH} → amd64 (or arm64)
#   ${SIGNING_FILE} → /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/<name>.gpg (resolved at install time)

profiles:
  default:
    install:
      # Script path uses ${ID} — resolves to scripts/ubuntu/setup.sh
      scripts:
        - scripts/${ID}/setup.sh

      # APT packages with variable in name (will fail to install but should resolve)
      apt:
        - doesnotexist-${MS_ARCH}-vartest
